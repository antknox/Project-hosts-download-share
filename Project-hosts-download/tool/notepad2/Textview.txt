  traceless uninstall.


Runtime DLLs

  Textview requires the msvcr70.dll and msftedit.dll runtime libraries.
  If these files are not present on your machine, you can download them

  system directory or into the same directory as Textview.exe.

Tips and Tricks, Special Features, Limitations

  Setting more Options and Custom Filters

  The Textview.reg file contains additional program settings that must
  be modified directly in the registry. These settings include custom
  filters for the drop-down menu of the filter dialog and customization
  options for the toolbar bitmaps and texts. Inspect Textview.reg to
  find more explanations.


  The "Show - System Objects" Command

  System objects are not only files with the system and/or hidden
  attributes set, but also binary files and device drivers not relevant
  to the user, exactly as in Windows Explorer.


  The "Fixedsys" Font

  Note that the "Fixedsys" font - and some others - support only very
  few font sizes. The "Enlarge/Reduce Font Size" commands have no
  effect with nonsupported font sizes.


  Supported Pathnames

  Textview supports UNC pathnames like i.e. \\comp\share. You can
  specify them as command line parameters or use the "File -
  Directory" command to access shared resources on other network
  computers. Moreover, pathnames can be relative or may contain
  environment variables. Long names containing blanks must be put into
  quotation marks, as usual for Windows (but not in the "Options"
  dialog box).


  Command Line Parameters

  Textview.exe [file|dir]
               [/n] [/f] [/u] [/i]
               [/m [-]FileSpec[;FileSpec2][...]]
               [/p x,y,cx,cy[,max]]

    file|dir: File or directory to open, can be a relative pathname.
    /n: Always open a new Textview window, even if the "reuse-window"
        option is on.
    /f: Jump to "Favorites" folder at startup.
    /u: Remove the registry entries created by Textview.
    /i: Start as tray icon.
    /m: Specify multiple file filters separated by ; and optionally
        prefixed by - to indicate negative filters.
    /p: Set window position to x,y with size cx,cy, optional value max
        set to nonzero to maximize window.


  Tip: Adding Textview to the "Send To..." Menu

  You can add Textview to the "Send To..." menu by creating a link to
  Textview in your SendTo folder of your Windows-directory. Right-
  clicking a file or folder in Explorer and selecting "Send To...
  Textview" will open the selected file or directory in Textview.


  Passing Command Line Options to Quickviewer and Editor

  If you would like to pass some command line options to the quickview
  and edit programs specified in the "Locations" property page, you can
  use links to these programs and include the command line options in
  the "Target" field of the link.


  "Open with..." can copy Files

  If you create a link to a folder and place it in the directory used
  by the "Open with..." dialog, files and directories will be copied to
  that folder when you choose it as the target for the "Open with..."
  operation.


  Limitations in Unicode and Mac Support

  Full Unicode, UTF-8, UTF-7 and Mac support is only available on NT-
  based Windows (NT/2k/XP). It's not possible to search the text for
  extended characters. Copy to clipboard has full Unicode support.

  Wider Unicode support on 9x-based systems (95/98/Me) can be enabled
  using a registry flag explained in Textview.reg.

  Some display problems might appear and are most probably caused by
  mssing codepages or fonts. Try using the default codepage (Ctrl+0).
